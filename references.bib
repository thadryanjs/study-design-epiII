  abstract = {More than 750,000 people in the United States died from an overdose between 1999 and 2018; two-thirds of those deaths involved an opioid. In this review, we present trends in opioid overdose rates during this period and discuss how the proliferation of opioid prescribing to treat chronic pain, changes in the heroin and illegally manufactured opioid synthetics markets, and social factors, including deindustrialization and concentrated poverty, contributed to the rise of the overdose epidemic. We also examine how current policies implemented to address the overdose epidemic may have contributed to reducing prescription opioid overdoses but increased overdoses involving illegal opioids. Finally, we identify new directions for research to understand the causes and solutions to this critical public health problem, including research on heterogeneous policy effects across social groups, effective approaches to reduce overdoses of illegal opioids, and the role of social contexts in shaping policy implementation and impact.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) approved the first mobile medication unit (i.e., a van to administer methadone) in 1988 and approved units on an ad hoc basis until issuing a moratorium in 2007 citing concerns about safety and diversion. In February 2020, the DEA released a notice of proposed rulemaking to permit a resumption of mobile medication units. The Biden Administration plans to release the final rule in 2021. Because a preliminary scan suggested limited evidence, a scoping review examined the research related to methadone vans to identify and assess the extent of mobile methadone research and inform the development and implementation of new mobile services. METHODS: A scoping review, supplemented with key informant interviews, identified and described the most relevant evidence. Ovid MEDLINE and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases were searched from inception to July 2020. RESULTS: Informant interviews provided perspective on the need for and the use of mobile medication units, the history of methadone vans, and benefits and problems associated with the units. The scoping review found limited evidence: three cohort analyses (one prospective) and one before and after analysis (four studies) of individuals using mobile medication services. Mobile services were associated with enhanced retention in care (relative to patients in fixed site programs) and mobile units appeared to facilitate access for underserved populations with opioid use disorders. DISCUSSION: The key informants addressed the history of methadone vans, the potential use to serve rural communities and correctional facilities and the benefits and problems associated with mobile services. The scoping review found evidence that mobile services increase methadone access among underserved populations and may enhance retention in care. The DEA's proposed regulatory modification creates opportunities to further evaluate the implementation and the effects of mobile medication units.},

One reason for this is that many buprenorphine treatment programs have rigid requirements for entry and continuation, limiting the number of people who receive treatment. "Low-threshold treatment" is a term used to describe an alternative approach that attempts to remove as many barriers to treatment as possible. However, few studies have described its essential features. In this article, we define low-threshold treatment and propose the approach be guided by the following principles: same-day treatment entry; harm-reduction approach; flexibility; and wide availability in places where people with opioid use disorder go. We discuss the evidence and rationale for these principles and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In 1974, President Nixon signed the Narcotic Addiction Treatment Act, which gave statutory authority to the regulations governing the provision of methadone for the treatment of opioid use disorder (OUD) in the US. The original name for the bill was revealing: the Methadone Diversion Control Act. These regulations that were meant to restrict dispensation on methadone have undergone only modest revision over the ensuing decades even in the midst of a current overdose epidemic. In the US, methadone for OUD can only be provisioned at federally certified opioid treatment programs (OTPs). Patients receiving methadone must present to an OTP for initial evaluation and then return 6 days a week for medication dispensing for at least the first 90 days of treatment (the latter requirement was relaxed during the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic). At least weekly dispensing is required through the first year and only if patients meet specific requirements. The federal law (42 CRF 8) also mandates patients regularly engage with counseling services; state and municipal governments then layer on additional requirements.},

Using data from telephone interviews with 250 administrators of publicly funded SUD treatment programs, this study estimated a model of adoption of medication assisted treatment (MAT) for SUDs and examined the relative importance of regulatory, cultural, medical resource, patient-level, and funding barriers to MAT implementation. MAT-adopting programs had significantly greater medical resources, as measured by the employment of physicians and nurses, than non-adopting programs. Administrators of non-adopting programs were asked to rate the importance of 18 barriers to MAT implementation. The most strongly endorsed barriers were regulatory prohibitions due to the program’s lack of medical staff, funding barriers to implementing MAT, and lack of access to medical personnel with expertise in delivering MAT. Barriers related to insufficient information about MAT and unsupportive staff attitudes were not widely endorsed. These findings suggest that efforts to promote the implementation of MAT that are inattentive to funding barriers and weaknesses in medical infrastructure may achieve sub-optimal results.},

  abstract = {Background and aims Opioid overdose is a leading cause of death during the immediate time after release from jail or prison. Most jails in the United States do not provide methadone and buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder (MOUD), and research in estimating its impact in jail settings is limited. We aimed to test the hypothesis that in-jail MOUD is associated with lower overdose mortality risk post-release. Design, setting and participants Retrospective, observational cohort study of 15 797 adults with opioid use disorder who were released from New York City jails to the community in 2011–2017. They experienced 31 382 incarcerations and were followed up to 1 year. Measurements The primary outcomes were death caused by accidental drug poisoning and all-cause death. The exposure was receipt of MOUD (17 119 events) versus out-of-treatment (14 263 events) during the last 3 days before community re-entry. Covariates included demographic, clinical, behavioral, housing, health-care utilization and legal characteristics variables. We performed a multivariable, mixed-effect Cox regression analysis to test association between in-jail MOUD and deaths. Findings The majority were male (82\%) and their average age was 42 years. Receiving MOUD was associated with misdemeanor charges, being female, injection drug use and homelessness. During 1 year post-release, 111 overdose deaths occurred and crude death rates were 0.49 and 0.83 per 100 person-years for in-jail MOUD and out-of-treatment groups, respectively. Accounting for confounding and random effects, in-jail MOUD was associated with lower overdose mortality risk [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.20, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.08–0.46] and all-cause mortality risk (aHR = 0.22, 95\% CI = 0.11–0.42) for the first month post-release. Conclusions Methadone and buprenorphine treatment for opioid use disorder during incarceration was associated with an 80\% reduction in overdose mortality risk for the first month post-release.},

  abstract = {Background: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States (US) was already facing an epidemic of opioid overdose deaths. Overdose deaths continued to surge during the pandemic. To limit COVID-19 spread and to avoid disruptions in access to medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD), including buprenorphine and methadone, US federal and state agencies granted unprecedented exemptions to existing MOUD guidelines for Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs), including loosening criteria for unsupervised take-home doses. We conducted a qualitative study to evaluate the impact of these policy changes on MOUD treatment experiences for providers and patients at an OTP in California. Methods: We interviewed 10 providers (including two physicians, five social worker associates, and three nurse practitioners) and 20 patients receiving MOUD. We transcribed, coded, and analyzed all interviews to identify emergent themes. Results: Patient participants were middle-aged (median age 51 years) and were predominantly men (53\%). Providers discussed clinical decision-making processes and experiences providing take-homes. Implementation of expanded take-home policies was cautious. Providers reported making individualized decisions, using patient factors to decide if benefits outweighed risks of overdose and misuse. Decision-making factors included patient drug use, overdose risk, housing status, and vulnerability to COVID-19. New patient groups started receiving take-homes and providers noted few adverse events. Patients who received take-homes reported increased autonomy and treatment flexibility, which in turn increased likelihood of treatment stabilization and engagement. Patients who remained ineligible for take-homes, usually due to ongoing non-prescribed opioid or benzodiazepine use, desired greater transparency and shared decision-making. Conclusion: Federal exemptions in response to COVID-19 led to the unprecedented expansion of access to MOUD take-homes within OTPs. Providers and patients perceived benefits to expanding access to take-homes and experienced few adverse outcomes, suggesting expanded take-home policies should remain post-COVID-19. Future studies should explore whether these findings are generalizable to other OTPs and assess larger samples to quantify patient-level outcomes resulting from expanded take-home policies.},
